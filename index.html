    <h1>Game of Pig</h1>
    <p>Two players. The player whose turn to roll the dice. The total is added to the
        current player's cumulative total unless either die comes up as a "one ".
    </p>
    <p>If this happens, this player's turn is over
        , the <strong>cumulative total zeroed out</strong> and the other player's turn .
    </p>
    <p>After each roll , the current
        player can either roll again,(assuming a "one"
        was not rolled) or if the current player feels that the luck is running thin, then can pass to the other
        player and the cumulative total will be added to the score.
    </p>
    <p> The first player to get higher score than
        <strong>Check Point</strong> wins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, and if you roll <strong>two "ones" (snake eyes) </strong> , your current <strong>score gets zeroed
            out</strong> . So ,beware!.
